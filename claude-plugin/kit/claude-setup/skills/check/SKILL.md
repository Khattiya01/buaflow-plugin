name: check
description: Check finished work before asking a human to approve. Runs verify for real, compares the diff to the plan, then hands the diff to the built-in /code-review and /security-review. Use after /task and before /done. Not named /review because that collides with the built-in alias.

Check: $ARGUMENTS

Talk to the user in Thai. Pass findings from the built-ins and the subagent through in whatever language they arrive; add your verdict lines in Thai.

## Current state

!`git status --short || true`

!`git --no-pager diff --stat HEAD || true`

---

## 0. Which track

Read `track:` in the task file (`docs/backlog/tasks/<ID>.md`)

| track | Do |
|---|---|
| `trivial` (typo / copy / log / one-line chore) | step 1 → `/code-review low` → step 5 only |
| `full` (default) | every step |

## 1. Run the real thing first — never review broken code

```
node .claude/verify.js
```

- Fails → **stop, fix first**, then start over
- Passes → paste the summary line `verify` prints (not the full log — it is in `.verify.log` if anyone wants it)

## 2. Compare against what was promised

Read **only** `docs/plans/<T-xxx>.md` (none → use the ACs in the task file instead).
plan.md has a "Distilled requirements" section with the constitution articles + ACs that apply to this task — **do not re-read the spec / constitution in full**.

Answer three things:
- What in the plan **was not done** — why
- What was **done beyond the plan** — why it was necessary (can't explain = scope creep)
- The Proofs in the plan — **actually run them and paste the results**

## 3. Hand the diff to the built-ins

In this order:

1. **`/code-review`** — level by diff size: ≤ 3 files → `low`, normal → `medium`, touches auth / money / migrations → `high`
2. **`/security-review`** — **only when** the diff touches `auth`, `api`, `prisma`, `migrations`, uploads, or env/secrets
3. subagent **`code-reviewer`** — checks what the built-ins cannot know: matches the plan? violates which constitution article? project standards.
   **Give it exactly three things**: the path to plan.md, the constitution articles distilled in the plan, and the **command** `git diff main...HEAD` — **the command, never the diff itself** (it has `Bash`; a pasted diff is billed in both contexts, and the `--stat` above is all steps 2 and 5 need here).
   Do not let it re-read AGENTS.md / DoD / the whole spec, and do not copy `REVIEW.md` in — it reads that itself.

> Why split: `/code-review` finds bugs better than a hand-written prompt but doesn't know what this project agreed on.
> Our subagent knows the project rules but shouldn't waste time hunting off-by-ones again.

## 4. Per-type checks — report **only failing items**

The path-scoped rules (`.claude/rules/*.md`) already loaded the DoD for this work type when you touched the files.
Go through it and write only: `DoD <type>: N/M pass — failing: <items>` — **never enumerate every item as prose**.

Extra things that usually slip and no linter catches:
- secrets / values that belong in env
- leftover debug logs, files that should not be committed
- commit messages malformed or missing the task id

## 5. Summary for the human to decide — short

```
T-xxx <title>
verify: <summary line from verify>
plan:   complete / missing <..> / extra <..>
review: /code-review <n> findings · /security-review <n> · code-reviewer <n>
DoD:    <type> N/M — failing: <..>

Must fix before merge:  (path:line — what — how it breaks)
Should fix:
Open as a separate task:
```

Results from `/code-review` and the subagent are **passed through as they reported them** — do not rewrite them; add only your verdict lines.
At most 5 observations total. If nothing reaches "must fix", say so plainly.

Then ask: **fix now** or **approve → `/done`**

> **The AI does not approve its own work** and does not merge — a human merges the PR after the gate passes.
> "Feed lessons back into config" happens in `/done` only; do not ask it again here.

## 6. Record the result (usage capture)

Run this once, right after the summary, and **only once** — a second run with the same verdict and findings is refused and says so, so never re-run it to "make sure".

`verdict` answers one question: **can this be merged as it stands now, at the moment you record?**

- `fail` — something in "Must fix before merge" is still open: not fixed, or fixed but unproven (a check only a human can do, a test that cannot run here).
- `pass` — nothing is left to do before merge, including when this round found must-fix items and fixed them all first.

Do not decide the verdict from how many items the list had. Findings carry that: record every item of all three lists, one per line as written there, each prefixed with its list — `must-fix:`, `should-fix:` or `separate-task:` — including the must-fix items you fixed during this round, with how they were fixed. Those are the whole point of recording: each one is something the plan, the standards or the task description failed to prevent, and the report ranks tasks by how many of them a round had to catch. No items → pass nothing between the markers.

```bash
node .claude/usage.js record check --task <ID> --verdict pass|fail --level <code-review level> --findings - <<'EOF'
must-fix: <path:line — what — how it breaks>
should-fix: <...>
separate-task: <...>
EOF
```

It does nothing unless the project opted in (`.buaflow/usage.json`). If the file is missing or the command fails for any reason, skip it without comment. Recording must never change or fail `/check`.
