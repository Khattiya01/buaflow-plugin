Prototype: $ARGUMENTS

Talk to the user in Thai.

## What this is — say it before starting
A **click-through to discuss the design**, not an app: buttons navigate between screens and switch states (empty / loading / error), mock data fills the artboards. No validation, no calculation, nothing is saved. Anything that "works" is the real build after Phase 7 (which must match the canvas 100% by `ui-component-rules.md` §8).

It is design-identical **by construction**: `.claude/prototype.js` copies each baseline artboard byte-for-byte and injects one `<script>` before `</body>`. It never draws or restyles anything. If a screen is not in `docs/design/canvas/`, it cannot be in the prototype — go through `/ui` (canvas path) first.

## 1. Preconditions
- `docs/design/canvas/*.dc.html` exists and is the confirmed baseline (Phase 3 route D / `/ui`). Nothing there → stop, say so.
- `docs/design/prototype/flow.json` — if missing, create it from `docs/templates/prototype-flow.tpl.json` (step 2). Never invent artboards to fill it.
- `docs/design/prototype/dist/` is generated output: **never hand-edit, never commit** (`dist/` is gitignored).

## 2. Propose the flow — the user confirms it, the canvas does not know it
The canvas has no idea where "บันทึก" goes. Read the sitemap/flow in `docs/planning/03-ui-design.md` and the artboards, then propose `flow.json`:
- one entry per screen: `artboards` keyed `"<width>"` / `"<width>:dark"`, `states` for the artboards the brief asked for
- `hotspots`: `{selector, to}` navigate · `{selector, state}` switch state · `{selector, back: true}`
- show the proposal as a table (screen → element → goes to) and **ask before writing**. Screens no hotspot points to get a warning at build time; that is usually a missing link in the flow, not fine.

## 3. Mock data — optional, ask where it comes from
Bindings put data into the DOM without touching markup: `{selector, path}` text · `{selector, attr, path}` attribute · `{selector, repeat, fields}` clones the first matched row per item. `format`: `number` · `currency:THB` · `date` · `datetime`.

Data lives in `docs/design/prototype/data/<screen>.json`. Ask which source:
| Source | Rule |
|---|---|
| Hand-written (greenfield) | realistic lengths per brief 1.9 — 40-char names, 7-digit amounts, full dates. Short fake values hide layout bugs the customer will hit. |
| Exported from a DB (rebuild / existing) | write a one-off export script, **sanitize before saving**: mask names, phone, email, addresses, IDs; drop anything under NDA. Real customer data never enters the repo — the link goes to people outside the team. Keep ≤ 50 rows per list; the generator warns above 512 KB. |

If the artboard already shows sample content and nobody asked for data, skip bindings. Bindings are for "does the layout hold with real-looking data", not for completeness.

## 4. Generate and verify
```
node .claude/prototype.js --check    # flow.json, files, data, targets — fix every FAIL
node .claude/prototype.js            # writes docs/design/prototype/dist/
```
Open `dist/index.html` and actually click the flow: every hotspot in the table from step 2, every state, every viewport, dark if present. The toolbar shows **⚠ N** when a selector in `flow.json` matched nothing in that artboard — fix the selector, do not leave it. `present` hides the toolbar for a customer walkthrough (Esc brings it back; `?bare=1` in the URL does the same).

`warn: อ้าง URL ภายนอก` means the artboard loads fonts/images from the web — fine for Google Fonts, but tell the user the link needs internet.

## 5. Publish and record
Publish `dist/index.html` with `dist/_proto.js` and `dist/screens/**` as supporting files (Artifact, `files`), first time with `icon: "prototype"`. Reuse the same artifact URL on every refresh so the link the team already has stays valid.
Record `prototype_url` in `docs/design/brief.md`. The prototype is private by default; sharing it is the user's call.

## 6. Keep it equal to the canvas — this is the rule that matters
The prototype is a **view of the baseline**. Whenever the baseline changes — a canvas drift sync (Phase 8.8), a deviation written back from `/ui`, a new screen — run `/prototype` again and republish to the same URL. A stale prototype is worse than none: the team discusses a design that no longer exists.

Never fix a design problem in `dist/` or in `flow.json`; fix it on the canvas, commit the new `.dc.html`, regenerate.
