Close: $ARGUMENTS

Talk to the user in Thai. The task file notes are in Thai; commit messages and PR titles are English (Conventional Commits); the PR body is Thai.

**Merge mode** — read `mergeMode` in `.claude/stack.json` (missing → `pr`). It decides step 2.

## Pre-close checks

- [ ] Passed `/check` — `pr`: **and the user approved** · `direct`: the last `/check` had nothing in "Must fix before merge" (that is the approval; the user chose this mode)
- [ ] The branch has the latest main: `git fetch origin && git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main HEAD` — not an ancestor → `git merge origin/main` (never rebase a pushed branch), resolve conflicts as `/check` step 1 says for this mode, and verify again
- [ ] `node .claude/verify.js` passes (run it again; paste the summary line)
- [ ] Every Proof in the plan/task is done and shown
- [ ] `node .claude/docs-lint.js` passes

Anything missing → say what, then stop. **Never close unfinished work.**

## Steps

### 1. Update the task file (one place — this is the source of truth)

Edit the frontmatter of `docs/backlog/tasks/<ID>.md`:
```yaml
status: review          # pr: not done yet — done when the PR is merged · direct: step 2 sets done
branch: <branch>
```
Add to the "notes while working" section anything the next person should know.

If the diff differs materially from `plan.md` → update plan.md to match reality (a plan that lies makes the next estimate wrong).

### 2a. `mergeMode: pr` — push and mark the PR ready for review — **never merge yourself**

`/task` step 5 already opened this PR as a **draft** the moment the task was claimed (so the claim was
visible on the git host from the start, not just at the end). Push the final commits and undraft it:

```bash
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr ready              # removes draft status — or `gh pr edit --add-label ...` etc as needed
```

No existing PR (old task from before this existed, or `gh`/`glab` was unavailable at claim time)?
Create one now instead: `gh pr create --base main --fill` (or `glab mr create`).

Update the PR body/description with: the summary from `/check` step 5 (short) + link to plan.md + the verify summary line.
**A human merges** after the gate (CI) passes — even solo: it takes 10 seconds and leaves a record of who approved.

> `guard-bash.js` blocks `git merge` / `git push` into main in this mode — if you are blocked, you are doing it wrong; do not look for a way around.

Then wait for the merge and continue at step 3.

### 2b. `mergeMode: direct` — squash-merge into main and push it yourself

One task = one commit on main, plus a one-line commit that records its hash (`docs-lint` needs `commit:` on a done task, and a commit cannot contain its own hash).
Work from a detached `origin/main` rather than local `main` — that works the same in a git worktree, where `main` may be checked out elsewhere.

1. On the task branch, do the step-3 task-file updates below (`status: done`, `closed:`, unblock dependants, intent) and commit them: `chore(<ID>): close task`
2. Squash onto the latest main:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git merge origin/main                 # nothing new → no-op; new commits → resolve as /check step 1, verify again
   git switch --detach origin/main
   git merge --squash <branch>
   git commit -m "<type>(<ID>): <summary>"
   ```
   The squash cannot conflict: the branch already contains `origin/main`.
3. Record the hash: `commit: <git rev-parse --short HEAD>` in the task file → `git commit -am "chore(<ID>): record merge commit"`
4. Push — **the pre-push gate is the check here; never `--no-verify`**:
   ```bash
   git push origin HEAD:main
   ```
   - **Gate fails** → `git switch <branch>`, fix it there (repair budget from `/task` step 5), and start again from 2
   - **Rejected because main moved** (another session or person pushed first) → `git switch <branch>` and start again from 2. Nothing was published, so the detached commits are simply dropped. Third rejection in a row → stop and report
   - **Rejected by branch protection** (the host requires a PR) → the host and `mergeMode` disagree; stop and tell the user to either allow pushes to main for this repo or set `"mergeMode": "pr"`
5. Clean up: `git branch -D <branch>` (a squashed branch is never an ancestor of main, so `-d` refuses) and `git push origin --delete <branch>` if it was pushed at claim time. Then `git switch main && git pull --ff-only` — if `main` is checked out in another worktree, stay detached; the next `/task` branches from `origin/main` anyway
6. **Other in-flight branches that change the same files** (other sessions, teammates) will now conflict with what you pushed — list them with the files, as in step 3. In an unattended run, just note them in the report

Skip step 3's task-file edits (done in 2b.1) and continue at step 4.

### 3. After the PR is merged (`pr`: the user says so, or `gh pr view` shows merged · `direct`: done in 2b.1)

- Task file: `status: done`, `closed: <date>`, `commit: <hash on main>`
- Tasks with `depends_on` this one → change `blocked` to `todo`
- **Frontend task** → unblock `T-xxx-test` to `todo` and tell the user there is test debt waiting
  (`docs-lint --release` refuses to release while it is open)
- Source intent fully done → `status: done` on the intent
- `git switch main && git pull && git branch -d <branch>`
- **Other open PRs that change the same files** — they will conflict with what just merged. List them and tell the user to pull main into those branches now, while the conflict is small:
  ```bash
  gh pr view <merged PR> --json files --jq '[.files[].path]'
  gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName,files
  ```
  Name each PR and the shared files. None → say nothing. No `gh` → skip

### 4. Regenerate the board

```bash
node .claude/board.js
```
board.md is generated — **never hand-edit** (a hook blocks it) and **never commit it**
(`docs/backlog/board.md` is gitignored — see `templates/gitignore.tpl`). It's a local view derived
from `docs/backlog/tasks/*.md`; committing it causes a merge conflict on every parallel PR since the
whole file gets rewritten on each regenerate. Anyone who needs it just runs the command above.

### 5. Docs that may need to follow

Ask only about what the diff actually touched:
- API changed → is `docs/api/openapi.json` re-exported?
- New component → `docs/design/components.md`
- Architecture decision made mid-way → ADR

Unattended run → do not ask; list them in the run report.

### 6. Feed back into config (only here — `/check` does not ask)

| Found during the work | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| The AI made the same mistake for the **2nd time** | `AGENTS.md` under "Things the AI gets wrong in this project" |
| A must-not-break rule that has now broken | a rule in `.claude/rules/` or a hook |
| Something that would hurt if it reached prd | an eval in `docs/evals/` |

Nothing qualifies → say so plainly. **Do not invent something to fill the section.**
(To judge "2nd time", look at `docs/evals/` and the "gets wrong" section in AGENTS.md — unsure → defer to Phase 8)
Unattended run → propose them in the run report instead of editing config yourself.

### 7. Close the context

Three lines: what was closed / tasks left in the milestone / 1–2 next tasks.
Then tell the user to **`/clear`** before the next task — old context does not help the new task but is billed every turn.
Unattended run → no `/clear` prompt; take the next task (`/task` "Unattended runs").
Milestone complete → remind them to run SonarQube and look at `/release`.
