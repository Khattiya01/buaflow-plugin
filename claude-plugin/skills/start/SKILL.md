description: Start or resume Buaflow in this project from the plugin — a new project, an existing codebase, or one that already has Buaflow installed. Use when the user asks to start Buaflow, set it up, or continue it. Upgrading the installed controls is /buaflow:upgrade.

# /buaflow:start

The whole Buaflow kit ships inside this plugin. There is no `buaflow/` folder to clone.

Reply to the user in Thai. Write every artifact under `docs/` in Thai.

## 1. Find the kit

The session context has a line `Buaflow kit <version> (from the buaflow plugin) is at: <KIT>`. Use that `<KIT>` path everywhere below.

- Wherever a Buaflow document says `buaflow/<path>`, read `<KIT>/<path>`.
- Run the CLI as `node "<KIT>/bin/buaflow.js" <command>`.

If that line is missing, the plugin's SessionStart hook did not run. Tell the user to restart the session, or to check that buaflow is enabled with `/plugin` or, in the VS Code extension where `/plugin` is unavailable, `claude plugin list` in a terminal. Then stop.

## 2. Read the project's state

The session context already says which state the project is in: the SessionStart hook compared the project's `.buaflow/lock.json` with the plugin kit before this skill ran. Take the state from that line. Do not run `doctor` or read `UPGRADE.md` to find it.

## 3. Take exactly one path

| State | Do |
|---|---|
| Installed, and either no lock or a lock older than the plugin kit | Tell the user in one line that the project's controls are behind the plugin, and that `/buaflow:upgrade` upgrades them. Do not upgrade here: it is a separate command, so opening a project stays quick. Then resume, as in the row for a lock equal to the plugin kit. The older gate keeps working until they upgrade. |
| Installed, with a lock **newer** than the plugin kit | The user's plugin is out of date, not the project. Tell them to update it (section 7) and start a new session, then stop. Never run `install` from an older plugin: it would put older files over newer ones. |
| Installed, with a lock equal to the plugin kit | Resume. Run `resume`, read `docs/planning/_state.md`, and continue from where it stopped. |
| Not installed | Read `<KIT>/START-HERE.md` and do Phase 0 exactly as it says. For an existing codebase, also run `doctor` and `assess` and give the user their result with the Phase 0 questions. |

Every rule in START-HERE.md applies unchanged. In particular: one phase at a time, stop at the end of each phase, and never guess.

## 4. Usage capture: ask once per project, on internal machines only

This applies on every path above: new and resume, including a project that still needs /buaflow:upgrade. Run `usage status --json` and read `data.store` and `data.consent`.

| `data.store` | `data.consent` | Do |
|---|---|---|
| `null` | anything | Say nothing. This machine has no central store, so it is not an internal Buaflow machine. |
| set | `unset` | Ask once, as below. |
| set | `enabled` or `disabled` | Do not ask. The project has already answered. |
| set | `invalid` | Do not ask. Tell the user that `.buaflow/usage.json` cannot be read, so nothing is recorded, and show the reason from `data.errors`. |

The question, in Thai, covers:

- what is recorded: the full intent, plan and task documents, status changes, `/check` results, the model and the kit version;
- where it goes: `.buaflow/usage/` in the project, which git ignores, and then the private store repository set on this machine;
- that the answer applies to everyone who works on this project, and can be switched off later in `.buaflow/usage.json`.

Then run `usage consent --enable` or `usage consent --disable` as the user answered, and tell them to commit `.buaflow/usage.json`. If it reports `not a git repository`, tell the user it will be asked again at the next `/buaflow:start` once the project is in git. Never answer for the user, and never ask again once there is an answer.

## 5. Installing the project-side controls (Phase 6 gate, Phase 7 handoff)

The plugin already gives this session the skills, agents and hooks. It cannot carry these, so they must live in the project:

- the gate and every checker, because pre-push and CI run them outside any session;
- permissions;
- rules and `stack.json`, because they are fitted to this project.

When Phase 6 or Phase 7 says to copy files from `buaflow/claude-setup/`, do not copy them by hand. Run:

1. `install --plugin` (a dry run). Show the user what it will create.
2. `install --plugin --write`. This copies the gate and checkers into `.claude/`, and seeds `stack.json`, rules, `settings.json` and `docs/templates/` only where none exist. It adds `extraKnownMarketplaces` and `enabledPlugins` so teammates who open the project are offered this plugin. It records `.buaflow/lock.json`.

Then do the project-specific parts of Phase 7 from `<KIT>/phases/07-handoff.md`:

- fit the rules' `paths:` and `stack.json` to the real project;
- write `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `REVIEW.md` and the constitution;
- set up the pre-push hook and CI.

Do not copy `skills/`, `agents/` or `hooks/` into `.claude/`, and do not add a `hooks` block to `settings.json`. The plugin provides them, and a second copy makes every hook run twice.

## 6. Phase 7 is not done until the project can enforce without the plugin

Before reporting Phase 7 complete, all of these must hold:

- `doctor` shows the core controls installed and a kit lock.
- `node .claude/check-config.js` passes. Run it with `BUAFLOW_HOOKS_DIR="<KIT>/claude-setup/hooks"` so the hooks are tested against this project's `stack.json`.
- `node .claude/gate.js` runs.

Tell the user one thing plainly: each teammate installs the plugin once: `/plugin install buaflow@buaflow` in the terminal app, or `claude plugin install buaflow@buaflow` in a terminal when using the VS Code extension. The marketplace is added for them automatically, but the plugin is not installed automatically. The gate protects `main` either way.

## 7. Keeping the plugin and the project current

Two things update separately, and both can fall behind without anything failing:

| What | How it updates |
|---|---|
| The plugin: skills, agents, hooks and the kit | Claude Code. Auto-update is **off** for a third-party marketplace until each person turns it on once: `/plugin` → **Marketplaces** → `buaflow` → **Enable auto-update**. Updates then arrive in the background after a session starts and load at the next session or on `/reload-plugins`. Without it: `claude plugin marketplace update buaflow` then `claude plugin update buaflow@buaflow`, then a new session. In the VS Code extension, where `/plugin` is unavailable, use those two commands in a terminal. |
| The project: gate, checkers and templates in `.claude/` and `docs/templates/` | Only `/buaflow:upgrade`, which runs `upgrade --plugin --write`, then committed. |

The plugin's SessionStart hook compares the two at every session start and shows the user a one-line notice when either is behind.

Tell the user about auto-update once, at the end of a new install (Phase 7) and after an upgrade. Claude Code keeps the setting per person and per machine, and nothing in the project can read it, so it cannot be checked from here. On a company machine, an administrator can turn it on for everyone with `"autoUpdate": true` on the `buaflow` entry of `extraKnownMarketplaces` in managed settings.
